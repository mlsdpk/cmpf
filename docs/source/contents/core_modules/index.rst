Core Modules
############

The framework contains various components of motion planning including route planning, behavior planning (or decision making), trajectory planning and path tracking controllers. It also provides implementations of several perception and behavior prediction plugins including state-of-the-art learning-based approaches from autonomous driving literature to be used with core motion planning modules.
